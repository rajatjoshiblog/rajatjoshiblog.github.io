title: Instagram, LinkedIn and the elusive productivity
---
UPSC results came out this week. My friend told me that the girl who scored rank 1
doesn't believe in studying like an ascetic. Instead she went on to say on national
television that she daily spends some time on social media platforms. Imagine being a 
parent with a civil services aspirant kid. You have inspired(trained) him/her 
to see the absolute glory of being an IAS. The values of hard work and self sacrifice 
which are aboslutely necessary to crack CSE have been inculcated in your ward. In this
materialistic society where kids are not even satisfied with the latest iPhone, your kid
is satisfied with his feature phone and physical copy of The Hindu. But then this girl comes.
Look at the balls on her to say in public that she uses Instagram. You and your kid sitting 
at dinner and watching this interview. The feeling is similar to watching a movie with the
family and suddenly in a stormy thunderous night, in between a dense forest, two rose buds 
bend towards each other and touch into a kiss. If it was upto you, you wouldn't have let them
see this. Same goes for the interview. 

But keeping the jokes aside, the obsession with social media today is perversive.
Paraphrasing from the great master(bater) Osho, who used to joke that priest only
thinks of sex and the prostitute of God. Similar are the obsessions with social
media. There are those who are glued to their phones, continously updating and 
getting updated. Every thought and activity for them is 'postable'. Then there are 
the social media priests. Those who are not on social media, or if they are they
don't get it.
