title: Instagram, LinkedIn and the elusive productivity
---

UPSC results came out this week. A friend told me that the girl who scored rank 1 doesn't believe in studying like an ascetic. Instead she went on to say on national television that she daily spends some time on social media platforms. Imagine being a parent with a civil services aspirant kid. You have inspired(trained) him/her to see the absolute glory of being an IAS. The values of hard work and self sacrifice which are aboslutely necessary to crack CSE have been inculcated in your ward. In this materialistic society where kids are not even satisfied with the latest iPhone, your kid is satisfied with his feature phone and a physical copy of The Hindu. But then this girl comes. Look at the balls on her to say in public that she used Instagram during her preparation. 
You and your kid sitting  at dinner and watching this interview. The feeling is 
similar to watching a movie with the family and suddenly in a stormy thunderous night, in between a dense forest, two rose buds bend towards each other and touch into a kiss. If it was upto you, you wouldn't have let them see this. Neither would you let them seethat vulguar botanical ravaging of the roses. 

But keeping the jokes aside, the obsession with social media today is perversive. Paraphrasing from the great master(bater) Osho, who said that the priest only thinks of sex and the prostitute of God. Similar is the obsession with social media. There are those who are glued to their phones, continously updating and getting updated. Every thought and activity for them is post worthy. Then there are the priests. There is a third type too. They are as obsessed as those who take pictures of their food. These are the snobs, the productivity freaks. Always arguing how social media is a waste of time,they like to put their time in meaningful pursuits like family, career and learning. In a nutshell, your average LinkedIn power user. In my own high headed attempt at being better in life I got off from Instagram and significantly limited my time on Youtube. But I still had LinkedIn. All my latent productivity that I was to gain from quiting Instagram was alas lost to LinkedIn and it was to say the least a different social setup.

I remember a time when LinkedIn used to be professional networking platform. Now it is swarmed with just 'content'. LinkedIn is dominated by three type of people recently, atleast in my feeds. First, the HRs. So how to know an HR on LinkedIn? They have posts for hiring. They offered a candidate more salary than they asked for. They have strong opinions about notice periods, but it could be for or against. They post content ending with 'Agree?'(But don't confuse them Influencers who do the same). HR used to be an easy Job few years ago. No rangoli jokes please. But with the rising demand of tech talent and IT boom in India, it is harder to be successful at HR, especially a recruiter. LinkedIn is a boon to HRs. Looking forward to more stories of corporate philanthropy from them.

Second are the FAANG engineers. You can identify them from their DSA resource posts, and hashtags like #leetcode, #faang, #leetcode. Even though there is a plethora of resources in tech available online for free, but everybody still gives some nuggets of gyan(FAANG wale bhaiya). This is not a slander of such posts. The social media community is rough. Here achievement is bragging, idealism is gaslighting, and Ankur Warikoo is funny. Everyone has too many opinions. Being good is not enough. You have to be perfect. So while achieving you have to be humble. In your idealism you have to be accomodating. The self censoring induced by social media is ingrained in us.

The third group is Product Managers. They also sometimes refer to themselves as Product @ Some Company. There are more posts on how-to become a PM than the number of PMs in the industry(same for data scientists). The world needs more product managers because your average engineer lacks the communication skills, and the higher view of things. But like Data Scientists, Product Managers are treated as wizzards who by a wave of their wand and a pinch of potion will get you the click through rates you have been fantasizing about. I'll say this - If you want your engineers to be more productive (especially in grunt work), definitely hire a PM.
