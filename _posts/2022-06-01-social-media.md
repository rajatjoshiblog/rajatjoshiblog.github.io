title: Instagram, LinkedIn and the elusive productivity
---
UPSC results came out this week. A friend told me that the girl who scored rank 1 doesn't believe in studying like an ascetic. Instead she went on to say on national television that she daily spends some time on social media platforms. Imagine being a parent with a civil services aspirant kid. You have inspired(trained) him/her to see the absolute glory of being an IAS. The values of hard work and self sacrifice which are aboslutely necessary to crack CSE have been inculcated in your ward. In this materialistic society where kids are not even satisfied with the latest iPhone, your kid is satisfied with his feature phone and a physical copy of The Hindu. But then this girl comes. Look at the balls on her to say in public that she used Instagram during her preparation. 
You and your kid sitting  at dinner and watching this interview. The feeling is 
similar to watching a movie with the family and suddenly in a stormy thunderous night, in between a dense forest, two rose buds bend towards each other and touch into a kiss. If it was upto you, you wouldn't have let them see this. Neither would you let them seethat vulguar botanical ravaging of the roses. 

But keeping the jokes aside, the obsession with social media today is perversive. Paraphrasing from the great master(bater) Osho, who used to joke that priest only thinks of sex and the prostitute of God. Similar are the obsessions with social media. There are those who are glued to their phones, continously updating and getting updated. Every thought and activity for them is 'postable'. Then there are the social media priests. Those who are not on social media. Most of such people I have met are either old, shy or have given up on any possibility of new things happening in their lives. You can say is a another type person obsessed with social media. They are as obsessed as those who take pictures of their food. These are the snobs, the productivity freaks. They often talk about how social media is a waste of time and the like to put their time in meaningful pursuits like family, career and learning. So, in a nutshell I am talking about your average LinkedIn power user.

I remember a time when LinkedIn used to be professional networking platform. Now it is swarmed with just 'content'. There only seem to be three type of people on LinkedIn. First, the philanthropic HRs who are apprarently treating employees like family and out of empathy dishing out huge compensations. Second are the Engineers who got placed at FAANG. Their *humble brag* about their hardwork, while giving tips and tricks to others. I think they got it from the countless enterpreneurship books that advice you to market yourself(the *brag*) but also give value addition to audience(the *humble*). I'll call this *value addition* as more like *value dumping* because most people really don't care. The third group is our beloved PMs. There is more content on how to become a PM than how to do a PMs work. But I love this group the most. Atleast they are  making creative memes. Other are just here because their content is too boring for Instagram.
